"Code Complete" is a cornerstone book for software development. Notes from the awesome book:

* Software Construction is the central activity in software development; constructions is the only activity that guaranteed to happen on every project.

* The main activities in construction are Detailed Design, Coding, Debugging, Integration, and Developer Testing (Unit Testing and Integration Testing).

* Other common terms for construction are "coding" and "programming".

* The quality of the construction substantially affects the quality of the software.
