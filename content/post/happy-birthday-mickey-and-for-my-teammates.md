Happy birthday Mickey, chuc em mot ngay sinh nhat that vui va hanh phuc. May our loving God grant you an even more peaceful and lovely 21 ahead ðŸ™‚

...

Heading home this weekend a few days to meet the team and do some final preps before we venture off to Bangkok for the important pitch at Edtech Asia. The journey has been great I would say. Ups and downs, we had both blissful moments and as well as depressing days. Nonetheless, our baby needs to be born, alive, and live strong. Please donâ€™t give up, my dear friends.

Please donâ€™t. Itâ€™s always easier to just quit. We have to work it out.

Itâ€™s tough and no point to predict the future. Our world is chaotic and miserable enough. Happiness is luxurious and safety is overrated. Nobody has enough time to complain. Tell myself to stop bitching and start working things out. In the very mess there will be greatness. The silver lining is in every cloud. We just need to have a little faith, and a bigger hope.

...

Oh well, love to see my little girls again ðŸ™‚
