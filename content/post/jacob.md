Had a chance to meet Jacob for dinner, after, like, 3 years we haven’t sat down for a chat. He is still the same guy I knew last time during the internship at Citi. An awesome asshole, a true man, in my language.

Maybe the only difference is now we are all graduated, and do different things in life. Jacob started his trading career, not engineering. Thou it’s tough, for a beginner like him, but at least he is on his way. He is the man of promise and focus. When we were doing our stupid IT internship at Citi, Jacob already set himself on fire with trading career. He talked about that, and did what he dreamed for. Spent the nonsense money to get the ‘f***ing expensive’ related master degree to join the rat race (his quote). And yet, still fetching the sweaty cash from parents to survive for the time being.

Still remember the moment we silently sat by the harbor after work for drinking. I was down. I can’t really drink much. So he drank all and listened to all my stories. We both were facing problems. I was stuck for a while. Jacob ate all the shit and moved on. Once for all, and very fast. Such a man.

We all agree that nationalism is nothing. It feeds no one but the fat politicians. That’s why we are good friends, no matter what.
