Love reading his (public) diary, thou many penned decades ago. Found deep maturity and grateful peace in his journey.

Uncle Cho sometimes encouraged me with his story about his little girl, Si En (Từ Ân).

Happy 21st Birthday ….daughter Faith Cho Si En

Faith Cho is celebrating her 21st Birthday today with the LORD and angels in heaven. She was so precious to Him that He allowed her only a brief stay here. Here is her story.
<br>
25thOct 1993
<br>
There is a land fairer than day.
<br>
After visiting construction sites in Jurong, I like to return to office in Sembawang using Jalan Bahar and Choa Chu Kang Road. These are country roads and in the early afternoons are usually deserted. Green fields spread from the roadside to the horizon. Trees with restful shadows line the road and separate the fields. It is a pleasure to drive leisurely along here, forgetting for a short while the very busy world.
<br>
Passing CCK Christian Cemetery always reminds me of Andrew’s father, Ray’s mother and Adrian’s father. They were buried there. Our dear baby girl, Faith Cho Si En was also laid there. She was born on the 25th October 1993, lived a brief 125 minutes and was taken to be with the Lord. We marked her grave with Jesus’ promise “Because I live, you will live also” (John14:19). She is in heaven and we look forward to meet her there.
<br>
Dolly and I have no regret in not aborting Faith as advised by our gynaecologists when her abnormalities were discovered around the 4th month. The experience had been traumatic but God’s hand was clearly guiding us. He made it absolutely clear to us that life begins from the time of conception. Once we understood this, foetus Faith became as much our child as Isaac and Samuel. We wanted to give her the best we could. We are grateful to have her with us even though it was for a short while.
<br>
And to Isaac and Samuel, Faith is a real sister who has gone to heaven. I remember driving with Isaac in the evening after the funeral to visit Dolly in hospital. We were listening to Christian hymns on the way. When we arrived at the carpark, he asked softly “Can we sit here and listen till the end? It is Mei Mei’s song.” We sat quietly in the dark, listening to the beautiful orchestra music of hymn ‘There is a land that is fairer than day’ which we sang during the funeral. When the music ended, he said “It is a sad tune. God will feed Mei Mei. When I get to heaven, I will hug her and kiss her. Now I will help Mei Mei to hug Mummy.” And that was the first thing he did when he saw Dolly in the ward.
<br>
Isaac is four and has accepted Jesus Christ as his Saviour. Samuel at 2 is still too young to understand fully. Faith Cho will continue to have a place in our family and a constant reminder of heaven. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. (Matt 6:21)
<br>
Now it is even more irresistible for me to travel along those country roads. And passing CCK Christian Cemetery, I love to sing “There is a land fairer than day, and by Faith we can see it afar!”
