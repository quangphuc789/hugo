Early education is getting more and more attention in every community. Developing the capacities of a little kid needs an holistic approach, which reflects on many different fields. In many different emerging economies and societies, parents normally focus on life and social skills for the kids. However, the ability to think and reason should be enabled as well. And usually, this is associated with maths or sciences.

I do believe that **logical thinking** plays an important part too. Teaching a kid how to program is a great way.

I have been experimenting on [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu), and found this is really an interesting tool. This helps the kids to learn the programming concepts, and be able to translate their creativity into actual programs.

So, let's take a look at what Scratch has to offer.

### Visual Programming

Unlike other programming language that requires users to type down texts, Scratch is a drag-and-drop based language, and that is perfect for the children to use. Users can reason and demonstrate their logical thinking through putting the lego blocks together to make the program run. With many visual tools and effects, users can create wide range of applications, from games to animation, to arts, and even music.

### Object Oriented & Event Oriented Paradigm

Scratch applications are built on many *real* objects, called **sprites**. Each of the sprite is an actual entity that has a view (display images), data and behaviours (scripts). Scripts contain logic and action flows of the sprite. Pretty much like methods in OOP objects.

Sprites can react according to events, and through broadcasting and receiving messages, sprites can connect and communicate with other sprites in the application.

### Logical Reasoning

Each of the code block will be associated with a shape, and this will be fitting to each other as a lego blocks visually. So in this way, kids can develop a sense of understanding *logic* in a more intuitive and childlike way.

The good thing that Scratch offers for young users is that, it is easy to demonstrate logic and program flow, and how events are broadcast and listened.

### Communities

Pretty much like Github, users can build apps, and share it to the community openly. All the source code will be visible to any visitor. This is really good for social and educational purposes. 

Any visitor can view & play the app, as well as *remix* it, like *forking* in Github. By this way, there is a very strong feel of an active and helpful community. Kids can learn and share, which helps to build their confidence and sharing mindset later on.

### My Experiments

I am documenting and structuring the contents, and knowledge of Scratch for education purposes, will be shared in other posts.

Below are my 2 attempts on building games on Scratch, including self learning time, in a night. I am confident that every kid can definitely do and enjoy this in their own pace.
