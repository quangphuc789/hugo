Last weekend passed by extremely fast. Worn out with the camp preparation in JB. Assisted our friends from the States for the camp. Glad to see Dr Bruce, Janette and Linda again. Had a great chance to collaborate with Peter, the first Egyptian have ever met, in giving medical checkups for our dear brothers and sisters.

I did learn something. Not just about healthcare related stuff, but about the lives of our brothers and sisters, the angles that I never knew before. I would never forget that chi Binh, she kept laughing that never took medicine in the morning, because I never had breakfast, likely to save a bit more for her kids still schooling back home. Through all the hardships and struggles, she always engraves a humorous sense and positive attitude.

And there was a mission group from Hong Kong, too. Talked to many of them. Through the testimonies, I could understand more, and personally, about that dark period after the communist reformation, esp in the North, in the mid of 90s. Love to see our fellow people are doing well faraway.

...

To be honest, that period the situation of my homeland was a bit better, and progressing. However, after the reformation, life was still hard. That’s why a large amount of northern people, some even from the center, and the south, fled to Hong Kong, since the neighbor countries already closed doors and protection camps. These asylum seekers went through a tough time. Not all were approved to be refugees, some were sent home. Being through the boat journey and tough time in the camp, still not as dark and lost as being repatriated, the moment one thought he already touched the shore of (what he thought) freedom.

Anyway, some managed to stay for good. Although after that HK turned their back to the Vietnamese, even til today. They implemented very strict policy for our countrymen to land for a visit. Had a chance to visit HK in early 2013, such an exciting and a great place anyway. Hong Kong, the term reflects itself, very different, both crazy and peaceful, chaotic and kempt, too. A beautiful land indeed.

...

Just sent a followup email to Duc to respond to some of his inquiries about the career path. So happy that he and his peers were enrolled to high school in Ba Vi. The government did move some further steps to let the less fortunate kids get back to life. Keep them in prayers. Hope that I can continue this distant fostering up in the years to come (oh, did I invent a new term). But, my heart is with him and his peers. They are smart and courageous. Being positive with HIV doesn’t mean the gates of life closed. I believe there is a way to go about with the stigma they are going to suffer.

Looking back, I went through the same feeling when my skin condition burst out. Thank God that I am an orphan too, I can understand them..

...

Too many things in my notes. Need to find time to pen down, probably. Not feeling well during these hectic days.
