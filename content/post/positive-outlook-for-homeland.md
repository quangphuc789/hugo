Had a chance to attend a sharing talk and visit couple of tech companies in Saigon a few weeks back. 

Thank God for a positive outlook, and a hope for a better future of our homeland. There are young and great companies in Vietnam that are really innovating and trying to boost the economy. There are people who continuously carry on non-profit projects going on to help out the society. There are young hearts and bright minds stretching days and nights shaping a better future.

Vietnam, a boat which is not perfectly seaworthy, but still trying hard for a better day.
