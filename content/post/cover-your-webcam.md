Cyber security is one of the most important things that everyone has to care about. Not just about losing your data or session over the web, your privacy can be violated right at the webcam of your laptop.

If you sometimes notice your webcam is on with the led, you may need to do some investigation. Attackers gain access to your laptop from the internet, through installing some malware into your computer once you accidentally visit a malicious website. This malware will be able to silently gain access to your data and hardware, steal your information and even capturing your face. This is really creepy. And this could apply for phone or tablet cameras as well.

To prevent:

* Regularly check and update your softwares, removing unnecessary programs.

* Use anti-virus tools to clean up your computer

* Put password/admin rights to sensitive information. Backup regularly.

* Best of all, cover up your webcam. No one will be confident enough to say they are immune from all the attacks.

Yes, cover up our webcams. Be safe.
