Will remember every time visit my bro Chuong at his place. Will remember the afterwork laksa bowls he made for me. Best laksa in town. Special and memorable, the joy of friendship.

Sometimes the best things in life are not free, just priceless.

...

For awhile.

Been a nomad. Pruned my stuff. Keep luggage light. Moved from places to places. Never thought of settling. Kept myself going. Enjoyed being that.

As well.

Trimmed off memories. Gave away the good. Left behind the unnecessary. Cloudified the important. Kept the crucial. Closed the expired. Just a username and a password. A mental nomad indeed.

...

Missing the good old days when I was enjoying music with my dear piano every night.

Whenever thinking about my dear piano, the word ‚Äúhome‚Äù pops out. An unfamiliar word. And nostagic too.

Just wish there shall be a better day üôÇ
