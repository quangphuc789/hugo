World Psoriasis Day.

Just another day of my very own journey. Remembered every moment I had as a human being, with all the joy and pain. This day reminds me of so many things I have been taking for granted.

Started to be a very small part. On my way to become someone that steps out of this hiding shell, raises awareness and gives advocacy to his fellas. Thank you Lord for everything that comes, plays a part and shapes our life.

So happy getting to know the Fantastic 6 ~.~ admire you guys much!

Jacob married.

So happy, man, my dear fren. 恭喜恭喜你！永远快乐！邀请我吧，我一定讲华语，可以啊？

More surprised to know that you have now become a Christian through your fiancee, mate. Believe you will be the true one, the true Christian that is Christ like. Because, He is the righteous God of the humble and the loving. And I am pretty sure, you are, dude.

Heard about Denis through the things he has done, how he has been helping out to our fellow men in need, such a great man. How much love and care he gave. Oftentimes I mistook him as a Vietnamese too, for his humbleness. May God bless you more and more dear, for your service and the coming marriage!

Giữa tháng 11 anh Tính về nước. Cũng sắp rồi, lần này là anh về thật luôn. Vậy là ở JB em lại thiếu đi một người anh, một người bạn yêu quý. Chúc anh mạnh khỏe và kiên trì trên con đường mới của mình. Em mến chúc anh mạnh khỏe và hạnh phúc mỗi ngày :)

Thank you father for keep strengthening me in my service of helping out my fellow friends in JB. There are times that I were basically overwhelmed by tiredness, laziness and lone. But your love and lessons have kept me on track :)
