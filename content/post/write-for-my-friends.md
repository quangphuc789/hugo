To KV, my bastard friend,

Read your new FB note today, dude, not pretty much surprised but I could see another angle of a guy whom I knew for long.

For years we had many things together. Being roommates. Traveled together. Started ventures. Coded through the nights to chase our dreams. All failed. But we failed together.

As always, we argued, quarrelled, did all the stupid things, and I hate you a lot too, asshole. But at the end of the day, we let bygone be bygone and start anew all the time. We hold nothing, simple as that. We have many things in common and we shared openly. That’s why I like you. We love to put things on the table and play a fair game. Not all people that I can share as much as you, dude. I know that everyone who comes to our lives, plays a part, and all the parts are different. Because hearts are unfathomable, and minds are endless.

We both write, and enjoy doing it. I am an engineer with the heart of an artist, while you are an tech banker who trusts in numbers. I don’t admire you because you were among the top of the cohort, but because you are a fearless man. Basically you are the only one whom I can always be talking about entrepreneurship, shooting ideas, and working on them.

Chasing our dreams and being responsible to our loved ones at the same time are hard. But I hold on firmly to the belief that if one does not step out of his comfort zone, learn, innovate, work hard and give back to society, he will be losing behind, sooner or later.

Congratulations on your love anniversary, dude. I know you are never serious about ‘saying’ serious, but you are always frank, that is honesty. Long way to go, man, and I know you will do stupid things all over again. Sure you will know what to do, mate. I know you are smart.

My housemate, invited me to be the witness for her Registration of Marriage. My honor indeed. A sense of trust. I hope you two all the best in the next phase to come. Pray for the move to NZ to be successful, and start a good life there. So happy she boarded the train of her life.
