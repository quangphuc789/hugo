I have delivered the first version of graphy.js.

Check it out here: [Graphy.js Homepage](http://www.quangphuc789.com/graphy.js/)

Graphy.js is an open source graph display library for the Web, based on HTML5 Canvas, Javascript programming, devops using npm and Gulp. The project is built and maintained by me.

The library is made to help edtech products in display graphical functions for secondary and high school education.

The project is on-going, and any help or suggestions are welcome. Checkout the source code, and raise discovered issues at [project github page](https://github.com/quangphuc789/graphy.js).
