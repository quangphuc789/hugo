“Have you thought a lot about the future?”
“Definitely. I have thought about it for sure, and how can’t you? It’s reality. But I think I just put that aside, you know, I’m here, and I’m gonna go step by step, day by day. And you never know what the future holds. I’m gonna keep on.”

Watched this today, my thoughts be with you Jon. Wish you, and your loved ones find peace and joy in every new day.

I believe no one goes through his or her life without any battle, just different stories altogether. And depression may hit anyone, anytime, no one is immune from that. Take a good care of your loved ones, and yourself too.
