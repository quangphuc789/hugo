Saw a few construction workers sitting on the grass field, alongside the kerb. They sat silently, looked afar. Probably finished work, and were resting.

Or they were just looking at the moving cars, like I were looking for my bus to come.

Or they were just missing home, thinking about the kids, like I were missing my little nieces..

There was a time, took bus from Checkpoint to Kranji, I saw a construction worker entered the bus. His body was full of dust, and no shoes. Lives are so different. A passer-by.

In Singapore, the construction workers are usually from South Asia, like India, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. Labor work never gets outsource from Vietnam.

The life of these workers are poor thou. My friend told me once they are injured, the boss will send them home and hire replacements. Some may be left with huge debts.
